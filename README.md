# 🌌 Game Overview  
- **Objective**: Collect **100 resources** by mining four unique planets: Mars, Europa, Ganymede, and Titan.  
- **Gameplay**: Tasks run in parallel, simulating real-time resource collection with varying speeds for each planet.  
- **Completion**: Planets complete their mining processes independently. The game concludes when the total resource goal is met.  

# 🧑‍💻 How to Play  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url/SpaceMiningSimulation.git

# 🛠 Features
- **Parallel Tasks**: Each planet mines resources concurrently for faster progress.
- **Advanced Continuations**: Tasks update their status and notify when mining is completed.
- **Resource Goal Tracking**: The game dynamically calculates and displays the total resources collected.
- **Realistic Simulation**: Includes delays to mimic mining times for each planet.

# 📋 Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure your environment meets the following requirements:

- .NET Core SDK 6.0+
- Visual Studio 2022
- Required NuGet packages installed via the project setup.

# 🌠 Final Notes
